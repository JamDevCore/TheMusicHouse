      <h1>Structure.</h1>
      <p>
        In the first term children are introduced to the
        keyboard and its structure. They learn where the notes live on the keyboard,
        and begin playing simple pieces using simple letter notation. We introduce basic notes values and music theory concepts, which gives children the core
        understanding of all the concepts while their keyboard skills develop.
      </p>
      <p>
        This level is designed to lay the ground for the students, after which they will begin reading actual music notation.
        Through experience we have learnt that introducing notation too early early can discourage children and
        discontinue their learning. We introduce the notes and their location on the keyboard first and allow time
        for this knowledge to be
        fully incorporated into childrenâ€™s understanding, before moving on to the notation.
